Hey! 

During day, I'm a theoretical physicist in computational neuroscience, trying to understand the brain as a dynamical system. I'm also building simulation framework called `neurolib` which you can [check out here](https://github.com/neurolib-dev/neurolib). 

During night, I usually do the same.

You can find more information about my projects on my [GitHub profile page](https://github.com/caglorithm).
