Following the estimations in the widely-shared Medium post from Tomas Pueyo [1], we assume the average time from infection to death at 20 days. This is used to estimate the time of the infections that lead to the observed deaths. Assuming a fatality rate of 1% allows us to estimate the number of infections that are responsible for the observed deaths. .
