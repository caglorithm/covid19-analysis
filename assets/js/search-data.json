            "content": "Last build 21.03.20 13:30:31 . Estimated time of infection vs. confirmed infection time . Following the estimations in the widely-shared Medium post from Tomas Pueyo [1], we assume the average time from infection to death at 20 days. This is used to estimate the time of the infections that lead to the observed deaths. We take the last calculated fatality rate per country (n_last_cases/n_last_deaths) to estimate the number of infections that are responsible for the observed deaths. . [1] https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca . Cummulative confirmed cases per deaths . click the country label that you want to highlight. Shift + click to compare different countries. . Growth of confirmed cases compared to deaths . Some countries start testnig the population earlier in the outbreak than others. The time delay between the increasing number of deaths and the confirmed number of cases is indicative for speed of the response. . Here, we measure the distance of the maximum of cumulative deaths and new deaths to the number of infections to estimate the progression of the infection across countries. . A comparison of countries with respect to their mean time for reponse is presented below. . To determine the above values, we plot the number of confirmed cases (solid black lines) and the number of deaths (dashed black lines). From this, we measure the distance of the day of maximum new deaths (dashed red lines) and the day of maximum deaths (dashed orange lines) to the day of confirmed cases at this y-value. . The distance is indicative for how fast the humber of confirmed cases increases comapred to the increase of the number of deaths. .",
